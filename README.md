This project includes API handlers under the `api/` directory. To run them
locally or deploy them, install the runtime dependencies and ensure that the
generated `node_modules` directory is bundled with your deployment.

```bash
npm install
```

The APIs rely on packages such as `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `mongoose`, and
`dotenv`.
